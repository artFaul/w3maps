Doesn't sound good, but--

Seems like we are not alone here as well.

Night Elves!

Jaina: Shandris!

Thrall: We are lucky to meet you here.

Shandris: I'm glad to see you, heroes of Azeroth. But unfortunately we can't just stay and talk here for undead army arrived to Ashenvale again. Good news is that my scouts have found out who is leading them.

Thrall: Well, who's that?

Shandris: It's a mysterious severe lich. Sisters had heard some troops calling him Kel--

Jaina: Kel'Thuzad?!

Thrall: Who's that man?

Jaina: He was the one, who spread the plague all over my homecountry, destroyed it and summoned Archimonde into this world.

Shandris: So, he was the one who made the Burning Legion come back?!

Jaina: Not the only one...

Thrall: You're okay, Jaina?

Jaina: Yeah, I'm just--

I'm sorry -- I must protect my people... till it's too late.

Thrall: Too late?
Hold your positions -- they might come back soon.

Shandris: I'll try to reach for Tyrande. Be careful, outlanders.
